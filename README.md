# Module 5 Challenge - PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project

The purpose of this project is to build a program capable of analyzing ridesharing data for the PyBer company. Our clients, V. Isualize and Omar, would like us to create a program that will read, merge, analyze, and plot relevant statistics from their company's raw CSV files.

## Results

Our program produces an analysis on the basis of the different city types where PyBer operates. Our analysis found the highest revenue (Total Fares) and volume of rides (Total Rides) and drives to come from Urban areas. While both the higest average fare per ride and the higest average fare per driver were in Rural areas.

## Summary

In conclusion, we recommend PyBer:
1. Advertise more heavily in rural and suburban areas in order to increase total rides.
2. Increase prices in rural and suburban areas to make up for difference in revenues when compared to Urban areas.
